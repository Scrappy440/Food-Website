# Food-Website

Welcome! 
The goal is a website that tracks meal satisfaction and calorie count. Users enter a brief description of their meals, adds an estimated calorie count, and selects one of five emotions to describe the meal. The website then tracks these logs. The website congratulates users if they are within their goals and meal satisfaction. 

We are using a HTML/CSS/Javascript frontend, Python backend, and SQL for database.
